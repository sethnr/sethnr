Computational biologist | Translational pathogen genomics | Population genetics  

I am an infectious disease geneticist working at the Yale School of Public Heath. I develop and apply genomic methods to understand **infectious disease epidemiology**, **drug resistance**, and **vector evolution** — translating research into impact for public and global health.

- Methods: amplicon sequencing, lineage/resistance calling, admixture mapping, selection inference, CNV detection
- Pathogens: RSV/HMPV · TB · Malaria · Arboviruses · Malaria vectors · Arboviral vectors
- Tools: Python · R · PyTorch/CUDA · Snakemake/Nextflow · Terra · Docker · PBS/HPC
